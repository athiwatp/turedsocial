Here is a slight modification to make this work with the Auth2.0 version of FB SDK.

In order to run the example:

- Download and install Punjab (https://github.com/twonds/punjab/blob/master/INSTALL.txt)
 * ensure the file punjab.tac has root.putChild('xmpp-httpbind', resource.IResource(bosh)) *
- Download and run tape in the example dir (https://github.com/metajack/tape)
 * tape -P /xmpp-httpbind=http://localhost:5280/xmpp-httpbind *
- Hit http://localhost:8273/facebook.html in your browser

In order for the FB part to work you'll need to configure the FB values in the javascript
and you'll need to configure your domain to work. I trick I use is modify the Hosts file
to point to localhost when called the domain value from your FB app.

Cheers!
